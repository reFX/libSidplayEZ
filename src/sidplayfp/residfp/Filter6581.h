/**
* The SID filter is modeled with a two-integrator-loop biquadratic filter,
* which has been confirmed by Bob Yannes to be the actual circuit used in
* the SID chip.
*
* Measurements show that excellent emulation of the SID filter is achieved,
* except when high resonance is combined with high sustain levels.
* In this case the SID op-amps are performing less than ideally and are
* causing some peculiar behavior of the SID filter. This however seems to
* have more effect on the overall amplitude than on the color of the sound.
*
* The theory for the filter circuit can be found in "Microelectric Circuits"
* by Adel S. Sedra and Kenneth C. Smith.
* The circuit is modeled based on the explanation found there except that
* an additional inverter is used in the feedback from the bandpass output,
* allowing the summer op-amp to operate in single-ended mode. This yields
* filter outputs with levels independent of Q, which corresponds with the
* results obtained from a real SID.
*
* We have been able to model the summer and the two integrators of the circuit
* to form components of an IIR filter.
* Vhp is the output of the summer, Vbp is the output of the first integrator,
* and Vlp is the output of the second integrator in the filter circuit.
*
* According to Bob Yannes, the active stages of the SID filter are not really
* op-amps. Rather, simple NMOS inverters are used. By biasing an inverter
* into its region of quasi-linear operation using a feedback resistor from
* input to output, a MOS inverter can be made to act like an op-amp for
* small signals centered around the switching threshold.
*
* In 2008, Michael Huth facilitated closer investigation of the SID 6581
* filter circuit by publishing high quality microscope photographs of the die.
* Tommi Lempinen has done an impressive work on re-vectorizing and annotating
* the die photographs, substantially simplifying further analysis of the
* filter circuit.
*
* The filter schematics below are reverse engineered from these re-vectorized
* and annotated die photographs. While the filter first depicted in reSID 0.9
* is a correct model of the basic filter, the schematics are now completed
* with the audio mixer and output stage, including details on intended
* relative resistor values. Also included are schematics for the NMOS FET
* voltage controlled resistors (VCRs) used to control cutoff frequency, the
* DAC which controls the VCRs, the NMOS op-amps, and the output buffer.

*
* The Rn "resistors" in the circuit are implemented with custom NMOS FETs,
* probably because of space constraints on the SID die. The silicon substrate
* is laid out in a narrow strip or "snake", with a strip length proportional
* to the intended resistance. The polysilicon gate electrode covers the entire
* silicon substrate and is fixed at 12V in order for the NMOS FET to operate
* in triode mode (a.k.a. linear mode or ohmic mode).
*
* Even in "linear mode", an NMOS FET is only an approximation of a resistor,
* as the apparant resistance increases with increasing drain-to-source
* voltage. If the drain-to-source voltage should approach the gate voltage
* of 12V, the NMOS FET will enter saturation mode (a.k.a. active mode), and
* the NMOS FET will not operate anywhere like a resistor.

* Notes:
*
* An approximate value for R24 can be found by using the formula for the
* filter cutoff frequency:
*
*     FCmin = 1/(2*pi*Rmax*C)
*
* Assuming that a the setting for minimum cutoff frequency in combination with
* a low level input signal ensures that only negligible current will flow
* through the transistor in the schematics above, values for FCmin and C can
* be substituted in this formula to find Rmax.
* Using C = 470pF and FCmin = 220Hz (measured value), we get:
*
*     FCmin = 1/(2*pi*Rmax*C)
*     Rmax = 1/(2*pi*FCmin*C) = 1/(2*pi*220*470e-12) ~ 1.5MOhm
*
* From this it follows that:
*     R24 =  Rmax   ~ 1.5MOhm
*     R1  ~  R24/24 ~  64kOhm
*     R2  ~  2.0*R1 ~ 128kOhm
*     R6  ~  6.0*R1 ~ 384kOhm
*     R8  ~  8.0*R1 ~ 512kOhm
*
* Note that these are only approximate values for one particular SID chip,
* due to process variations the values can be substantially different in
* other chips.
