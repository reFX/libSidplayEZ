/**
* The audio output stage in a Commodore 64 consists of two STC networks, a
* low-pass RC filter with 3 dB frequency 16kHz followed by a DC-blocker which
* acts as a high-pass filter with a cutoff dependent on the attached audio
* equipment impedance. Here we suppose an impedance of 10kOhm resulting
* in a 3 dB attenuation at 1.6Hz.
* To operate properly the 6581 audio output needs a pull-down resistor
* (1KOhm recommended, not needed on 8580)
*

* The STC networks are connected with a [BJT] based [common collector]
* used as a voltage follower (featuring a 2SC1815 NPN transistor).
* * The C64c board additionally includes a [bootstrap] condenser to increase
* the input impedance of the common collector.
