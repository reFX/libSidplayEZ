/**
* The waveform D/A converter introduces a DC offset in the signal
* to the envelope multiplying D/A converter. The "zero" level of
* the waveform D/A converter can be found as follows:
*
* Measure the "zero" voltage of voice 3 on the SID audio output
* pin, routing only voice 3 to the mixer ($d417 = $0b, $d418 =
* $0f, all other registers zeroed).
*
* Then set the sustain level for voice 3 to maximum and search for
* the waveform output value yielding the same voltage as found
* above. This is done by trying out different waveform output
* values until the correct value is found, e.g. with the following
* program:
*
*        lda #$08
*        sta $d412
*        lda #$0b
*        sta $d417
*        lda #$0f
*        sta $d418
*        lda #$f0
*        sta $d414
*        lda #$21
*        sta $d412
*        lda #$01
*        sta $d40e
*
*        ldx #$00
*        lda #$38        ; Tweak this to find the "zero" level
*l       cmp $d41b
*        bne l
*        stx $d40e        ; Stop frequency counter - freeze waveform output
*        brk
*
* The waveform output range is 0x000 to 0xfff, so the "zero"
* level should ideally have been 0x800. In the measured chip, the
* waveform output "zero" level was found to be 0x380 (i.e. $d41b
* = 0x38) at an audio output voltage of 5.94V.
*
* With knowledge of the mixer op-amp characteristics, further estimates
* of waveform voltages can be obtained by sampling the EXT IN pin.
* From EXT IN samples, the corresponding waveform output can be found by
* using the model for the mixer.
*
* Such measurements have been done on a chip marked MOS 6581R4AR
* 0687 14, and the following results have been obtained:
* * The full range of one voice is approximately 1.5V.
* * The "zero" level rides at approximately 5.0V.
*
*
* zero-x did the measuring on the 8580 (https://sourceforge.net/p/vice-emu/bugs/1036/#c5b3):
* When it sits on basic from powerup it's at 4.72
* Run 1.prg and check the output pin level.
* Then run 2.prg and adjust it until the output level is the same...
* 0x94-0xA8 gives me the same 4.72 1.prg shows.
* On another 8580 it's 0x90-0x9C
* Third chip 0x94-0xA8
* Fourth chip 0x90-0xA4
* On the 8580 that plays digis the output is 4.66 and 0x93 is the only value to reach that.
* To me that seems as regular 8580s have somewhat wide 0-level range,
* whereas that digi-compatible 8580 has it very narrow.
* On my 6581R4AR has 0x3A as the only value giving the same output level as 1.prg

	// Each such change steps the mixer DC offset - the volume nibble scales it, and

	// re-settled to the current operating point on the first sample and on every
	// subsequent $d417/$d418 write, so those steps produce no ring.
	//
	// Gating is by silence, not time: some tunes have long silent intros yet poke the
	// volume register during them (e.g. Chris Huelsbeck's "Shades" - 4 s before the

	* The default end of passband frequency is pass_freq = 0.9*sample_freq/2

	*
	* For resampling, the ratio between the clock frequency and the sample frequency

	* E.g. provided a clock frequency of ~ 1MHz, the sample frequency can not be set

	* overfill its 16k sample ring buffer.
	*
	* The end of passband frequency is also limited: pass_freq <= 0.9*sample_freq/2
