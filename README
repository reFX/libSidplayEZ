libSidplayEZ
============

https://github.com/reFX/libSidplayEZ

libSidPlayEZ is a C64 music player library which integrates
the reSIDfp SID chip emulation into a cycle-based emulator
environment, constantly aiming to improve the emulation of the
C64 system and the SID chips.

This is a modified version of libsidplayfp from Leandro Nini.
All future emulation improvements to libsidplayfp will be
integrated into this version as well.
